        L-VALUES 
 - l-values are values that have names and
    are addressable 
- modifiable if they are not constants 
- y = 100           - L-VALUE = y 
- x  = x + y        - LVALUE = x, R-VALUE = (x + y) 

******************************************

        R-VALUE
- anything that is not an L-VALUE is an R-VALUE
- R-VALUES can be assigned to L-VALUES explicitly

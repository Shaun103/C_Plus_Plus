        L-VALUES 

 - l-values are values that have names and
    are addressable 
- modifiable if they are not constants 
- y = 100           - y = L-VALUE  
- x  = x + y        - x = L-VALUE
		    - (x + y) = R-VALUE 

******************************************

        R-VALUE

- anything that is not an L-VALUE is an R-VALUE
- R-VALUES can be assigned to L-VALUES explicitly

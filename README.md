This respository serves as a place for reference material for C++ code.
The code here was the material I learned using the Udemy site. The material 
found here may not be helpful and/or confusing to navigate for others and is not inteneded
to be showcased as a "project". This folder also has some other projects that I have 
been working on. The URL for the Udemy course can be found below.
